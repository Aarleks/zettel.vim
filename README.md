# Zettel.vim

A Zettelkasten plugin for Vim

A Zettelkasten should be a repository for knowledge and connections between items of knowledge. It should contain notes (zettel) that are made up of content, references, tags, and cross-references. It should also be possible to see which other notes point to a zettel.
